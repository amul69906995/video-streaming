# Full Stack MERN Video Streaming
This project is a basic Full Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application for video streaming. In this initial version, videos are uploaded to Cloudinary and served with a secure URL. The next versions will enhance the functionality with dynamic serving, multi-resolution support, and HLS/DASH streaming.

## Basic Flow

### Video Upload:

- Users upload videos using a simple form.
- Videos are uploaded to Cloudinary and stored with a secure URL.

### Video Streaming:

- Videos are securely served using their Cloudinary URLs.

## Next Steps

### Version 2:
- Implement dynamic video serving, where users click a video to stream it from the backend.

### Version 3:
- Enhance multi-resolution support using ffmpeg for different resolutions.

### Version 4:
- Implement HLS and DASH streaming for adaptive bitrate streaming.
